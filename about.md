I’m Theresa- an English major turned Web Developer, with a passion for creating apps and telling stories, creating apps that tell stories, and telling stories about the apps that I create.

I’ve always had a love for grammar and syntax, since I was a fifth grader and the only kid in my class begging for more sentences to diagram.

It took about another ten years for me to figure out that my love for structure and desire to break things down into their smallest pieces made me more than just the grammar police, and I’ve been building things ever since.  Let’s create something together!
